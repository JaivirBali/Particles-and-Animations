# Particles-and-Animations
A3Q1 demonstrates particle effects: 
  -Click and hold to drag a rocket and then release in a given direction
  -After a period of time (coloured particles) or if it hits a border it will explode (white particles)
  -Based on how far it was dragged, it will move faster or slower
  -Rocket size corresponds to fuse size (smaller triangle = less time before exploding)

A3Q2 demonstrates animations with different cameras and perspectives:
  -Have a desk lamp in a standard position
  -Can move the lamp using '1','2','3','4','5' between 5 positions
  -Lamp will animate as it moves to position
  -Can switch between ortho and perspective projections using 'o' and 'p'
  -Can switch between 3 different views using 'j','k','l'
  -Could just hit spacebar to switch between all 6 combos of views and perspectives.
  -Animation will not break as you switch views/projections
  -Animation speed proportional to distance.
